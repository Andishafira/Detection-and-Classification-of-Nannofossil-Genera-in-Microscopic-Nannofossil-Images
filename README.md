# Detection-and-Classification-of-Nannofossil-Genera-in-Microscopic-Nannofossil-Images

##Dataset
The dataset used in this study consists of microscopic images of nanofossils obtained from the Paleontology Laboratory, Department of Geological Engineering, Universitas Gadjah Mada. The dataset was collected through observations made using a polarizing microscope on finely ground limestone samples.
The dataset consists of four classes: 
  - `Coccolith PPL`
  - `Coccolith XPL`
  - `Discoaster PPL`
  - `Discoaster XPL`
This is because the observed nanofossils belong to two genera: Discoaster and Coccolith, while the types of microscope polarization lighting used are Plane Polarized Light (PPL) and Cross Polarized Light (XPL).
